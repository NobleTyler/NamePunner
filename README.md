# NamePunner

This is a website that allows users to enter a name and see different name based puns.

## Installation

Use the package manager [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) to install foobar.

```bash
cd client
yarn install
npm start
```

## Roadmap
- [ ] Create a site that hits firebase for a list of name based puns and displays them
- [ ] show images of name base puns
- [ ] Use OCR to scrape the internet for images that relate to that name, that hopefully contains puns. Mainly from /r/tinder
